Welcome to the Lesson.ly api documentation! First you will need to get an api key by signing into your account and navigating [here](lesson_ly_api_key_url)  

Currently we only have language bindings for curl, however we are open to providing libraries in other libraries.  Contact us to let us know what libraries you would like to see to connect with Lesson.ly:  [here] (lesson_ly_contact_url).
